My live-build configuration for building my own Debian system: Debian Wheezy, i3 window manager, lightdm display manager.

The mirror links in configuration file point to my local approx proxy server.

This configuration is based on Debian Standard image.

--------------------------

live-build can be obtained from <http://live-systems.org/devel/live-build/>.
On Debian based systems, live-build can be installed with:

  # apt-get install live-build

live-build can be used to build this image with the following command executed
in this directory::

  # lb build

More information about live-build and the Live Systems project can be found on
